# üçï Pizza Arcade Jokers - A Balatro Mod

A vanilla-style Joker expansion that delivers a greasy slice of 90s pizza arcade nostalgia. Expect tokens, tickets, animatronic eeriness, and a possible appearance from a legally distinct rodent. Jokers were all coded on a CRT monitor. Play responsibly‚Äîno tokens required.
